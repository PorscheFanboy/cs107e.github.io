## Goals

During this lab, you will also be working on your final project for this class! We advise you to:

1. Assess how well you met your week 1 goal(s)
2. Confirm that you have all your hardware
3. Begin thinking about your demo

Again, you can refer to the [project page](/assignments/project) for more information on the project itself.

## TA Check In

At the end of the lab period, be sure to confirm the following items with the TA:

* What was your week 1 goal, and did you meet it? (If no, how will you change your plans?)

* How will you show off your creation on the final day?

* Do you have your keyboard? If you are not using it for your project, please return it to a TA.
