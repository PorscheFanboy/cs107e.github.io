Before leaving the lab, check in with a TA and tell them you and your
partner's answers to these questions.

1. Using the sample Makefile in the lab writeup (not the codegen or
   testing Makefile), trace what happens when you issue `make` with no
   command-line arguments: what does `make` try to build? How does it
   determine what actions to take?

2. Does your corrected version of `is_odd()` work properly for negative numbers? What test cases
	could you add to `main` to verify that?

3. There are 7 segments on a 7-segment display
   labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
   What segments would you turn on
   to generate a "0", a "1", an "A"?

Don't forget to return all tools to the shelves & leave your workspace as clean as you left it!
